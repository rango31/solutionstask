To improve the PET SHOP UML, we will use Parent References.

We modify the categories table to add a parent_id field that allows each node (of the same table) to store information about its immediate parent node (also in the same table), making it easier to move or change the tree structure.The relationship between categories will be hierarchical, forming a tree-like structure. Meaning there wont be any limit to the number of subcategories a product can have.

Each product (e.g., “Product X”) can now be associated with one or more subcategories (e.g., “Dry Food,” “Dog,” “Vitamins”).
Super categories (e.g., “Food,” “Vitamins”) will be linked to their subcategories using the parent_id field. 


Categories table
_______________________
|id                    |
|parent_id             | ** new field
|uuid                  |
|title                 |
|slug                  |
|created_at            |
|updated_at            |
------------------------


Parent References offer an efficient way to locate both the parent node and its children without complex queries or recursive operations. This method works well for trees with frequent read operations and a somewhat dynamic structure.

However, when adding or moving nodes, updating the "parent_id" for related nodes can be expensive especially in large trees or with frequent structural changes.

Choosing the right approach for storing trees in relational databases depends on the project’s requirements and the specifics of the data.
Alternative methods include: 

- Nested Sets
- Path Enumeration
- Closure Tables
